Ensure PDF printing is encouraged over paper-based storage."
Success Criterion - Optimize Documents,,,"Offer optimized, compressed documents in a variety of accessible file formats."
Success Criterion - Optimize Delivery,,,"If a document is likely to be re-used, generate the document once on the server-side (preferably on a cookie-free domain) rather than forcing the effort to be duplicated."
Success Criterion - Labels And Choice,,,"Clearly display the document name, a summary, the file size, and the format, allowing the visitor a choice if possible of both the format, and the language (if not the same as the web page).

3.21 Align Technical Requirements With Sustainability Goals,Medium,Medium
Success Criterion - Identify Requirements,,,"List (and choose carefully) the requirements of the product or service. A simpler technological implementation may use more human resources, but could have a smaller footprint. A prebuilt solution may use more system resources (and thereby produce more emissions upon render) but have a faster build-time (emitting less carbon during development)."
Success Criterion - Optimized Methodology,,,"As a general rule, coding from scratch is the best-performing methodology (though if an existing solution is actively maintained, it may be better optimized than what you could produce). Therefore, prefer native components and file systems to a WYSIWYG editor or heavy framework, and be considerate of the impact of third-party solutions."
Success Criterion - Static VS Dynamic,,,"If you do decide to use a code generation tool, consider using a Static Site Generator in preference to a bulky content management system. Because SSGs often start using a minimalist content entry format (like markdown) and all of the compilation is done before the website is uploaded, the emissions benefit comes from the server not having to place as much effort into serving pages (as they are static) for each visitor. In the case of a CMS, the dynamic nature of a site will involve additional computation (server-side processing) and bulkier libraries."

4. Hosting, Infrastructure and Systems
4.1 Choose a Sustainable Hosting Provider,High,Medium
Success Criterion - Monitor Metrics,,,"To assess the environmental impacts of hosting and detect overconsumption, some indicators should be monitored: energy / water usage, CPU / Memory usage, allocation of servers and CPU cores, etc. These indicators could be used to calculate metrics directly related to environmental impacts, such as Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE), and Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE). They could be displayed to visitors for transparency and monitoring reasons."
Success Criterion - Equipment Longevity,,,"Manage equipment responsibly by keeping them as long as possible, using them as efficiently as possible, making sure they are certified, and purchasing long-lifespan products."
Success Criterion - Recycling Waste,,,"Recover, recycle, and upcycle waste including equipment."
Success Criterion - Renewable Electricity,,,"Electricity comes entirely from sources with the lowest possible carbon intensity (ideally generated by wind or solar rather than from non-renewable sources). For example, Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) can help verify the source, or, ideally, prove that electricity comes directly from renewable sources."
Success Criterion - Remaining Emissions,,,"Compensate remaining emissions, keeping in mind that the priority should be to avoid then reduce them and only compensate for them if they cannot be avoided. Carbon credits may not be sustainable, therefore the effectiveness of an offset solution must be verified, shown to be both environmentally viable and sustainable, and part of a longer-term strategy to eliminate emissions entirely from a chain, benefitting the wider ecosystem."
4.2 Optimize Browser Caching,High,High
Success Criterion - Server-side Caching,,,"If using a CMS, install an applicable plugin to enable on-the-fly server-side caching. Otherwise, use the provided server configuration files to include and tweak the file-type cache expiration using expires, bfcache, or cache-control HTTP header."
Success Criterion - Offline Access,,,"Client-side JavaScript uses a combination of ServiceWorkers, WebWorkers, storage Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), or cookies (if necessary) to reduce friction in the user-journey. For example, through the use of a PWA (Progressive Web Application) to ensure that an offline version is available and accessible at all times to reduce inequality and improve accessibility."
4.3 Compress Your Files,High,Low
Success Criterion - Server-side Compression,,,"If using a CMS, install an applicable plugin to enable on-the-fly server-side compression, such as Brotli or GZIP. Otherwise, use the provided server configuration files to include and tweak the performance-related features to the requirements."
Success Criterion - Media Compression,,,"Compress your various images, fonts, audio, and video; by reducing the quality and offering different resolutions / dimensions (sizes) before uploading to a server or content management system."
4.4 Use Error Pages and Redirects Carefully,Low,Low
Success Criterion - Error Pages,,,"Maintain sites by ensuring links are correct, and if errors occur, provide suitable way-finding within optimized pages for each error type to ensure resources can be identified to help a visitor complete the task they started."
Success Criterion - Redirection,,,"Redirect websites, subdomains, and pages only when necessary. Proactively seek broken or outdated links and fix them. A redirect or search will often help reduce the number of pages a visitor needs to load."

Success Criterion - Necessitate Tasks,,,"To reduce wasted processing cycles, every automated task is only run when needed."
Success Criterion - Automated Scaling,,,"Use automated scaling infrastructure to automatically increase the capacity of the web server and implement buffering / throttling to respond to visitor demand."
Success Criterion - Security Tooling,,,"Web browsing from bots has been steadily increasing in recent years. As such, it is a growing concern for security, performance, and sustainability. Use security tools that automatically block bad actors and minimize bad behavior. This results in substantially less load on the server, fewer logs, less data, less effect due to compromise, and more. The result of compromised websites is a large increase in HTTP, email, and other traffic as malicious code attempts to infiltrate other resources and exfiltrate data. Compromised websites are typically identified by anomalous patterned behavior."
4.7 Maintain a Relevant Refresh Frequency,Medium,Low
Success Criterion - Refresh Frequency,,,"The frequency for refresh (of both the cache, locally stored data, and the page) is defined depending on visitor needs."
4.8 Be Mindful of Duplicate Data,Low,Low
Success Criterion - Data Backups,,,"Backups of system and user data are both incremental and secure."

Success Criterion - Batch Processing,,,"By default, non-critical processes and communications are batched and launched only when carbon-intensity is under a given threshold."
Success Criterion - Protocol Usage,,,"Ensure the communication protocols are relevant to the visitor's needs and data transferred. Avoid using insecure protocols (HTTP, FTP), and prioritize more efficient and privacy-aware data routes for visitors (HTTPS, SSH)."
4.10 Consider CDNs and Edge Caching,Medium,Low
Success Criterion - Content Delivery Network's (CDNs),,,"When building for a globally distributed audience, use a CDN to store and serve simple read-only, pre-generated resources in a fast and efficient manner. Although they definitely can increase performance, it is also another layer of infrastructure which needs to be considered for sustainability."
Success Criterion - Sustainability Commitment,,,"Check the CDN to verify that it provides a commitment to sustainability."
Success Criterion - Local Servers,,,"Choose a hosting provider with servers located close to the visitor."
Success Criterion - Avoid Caching Inappropriate Resources,,,"Avoid using the service to host dynamic resources or JavaScript (unless through a first-party host) as due to cache partitioning, cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), and other browser mechanics, any benefits are negated by weaker performance, the inability to cache or interact, and the potential introduction of security and privacy issues to be introduced. This doesn't affect JSON or other static assets."
4.11 Use the Lowest Infrastructure Tier Meeting Business Requirements,Medium,Medium
Success Criterion - Lowest Requirements,,,"Select infrastructure elements with the lowest requirements tier, meeting your service-level agreements. Avoid over-provisioning multi-datacenter, multi-zone, or distributed deployments if standalone instances meet the requirements. Also avoid provisioning infrastructure that will be under-utilized by provisioning for established average loads, ensuring reasonable resource utilization and autoscaling occurs as needed. Avoid provisioning for peak loads."
4.12 Store Data According to Visitor Needs,Low,Low
Success Criterion - Reduce Redundancy,,,"Remove unnecessary and redundant data from your servers, whether it is single-use (dark data) or abandoned."
Success Criterion - Expiration Dates,,,"Create data with an expiration date. Excess data is a form of technical debt, and routinely cleaning up old data needs to be normalized."
Success Criterion - Classify And Tag,,,"Use a data classification / tagging policy to make it easier to find, handle, and remove."
Success Criterion - Justify Storage,,,"Store data only when it is difficult to recreate."
Success Criterion - Optimize Logging,,,"Optimize log collection, storage (off-site), and rotation; scheduling during low-activity hours and using carbon-neutral backup providers."
Success Criterion - Compress Storage,,,"Enable storage compression both on the fly (Brotli or GZIP) and with long-term assets made available for download."
